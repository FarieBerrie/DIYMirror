# This is a website I decided to build to describe a project I made last Thanksgiving break. I built a smart mirror using a Raspberry PI 3 and an arduino Uno to read temps from outside.

## The about page has photos and examples of how I built it and what I used hardware and software wise. 

## The data page uses a table to display a json I made from the temps recorded from the arduin uno.
